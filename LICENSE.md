## Summary
Kingboard is using it's own LICENSE.

This license allows you to read, modify and use the Kingboard Code, aslong as you don't do that
under commercial aspects, meaning, as long as you do not make any profit in real or virtual
currency with it.

In special it does not allow you to run a hosted Kingboard service for real money
or virtual currency (EVE Online ISK for example). However you are allowed to run
a board for you or your EVE Online Corp/Alliance (seen as private use)

Excluded from this are the holders of a special hosting license.
